  MVP
* Two player game. The human is the PM and the computer is a monarch.

* The win/lose state can be reached in four ways. If either player hits 100 points in popularity, that player becomes dictator or absolute monarch. BUT - if either hits 0 points, they are removed/deposed depending if they're the PM or monarch.

* The PM gets to choose a monarch to go up against. Different monarchs secretly have tactics to randomly use. A few monarchs even have unique tactics different from the others.

* Each tactic the PM and monarch can use has different levels of popularity. Each tactic can backfire and reduce popularity too.

* One of the PMs tactics can backfire so badly that it causes a lose state of the game no matter how good their popularity was.

Future Fixes
* A small bug during game over state needs to be fixed. it continues to show the PM's choices.
* CSS will be improved.
* Monarch gifs will be added for different choices monarchs make.
